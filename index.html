        A friend was djing at a dark bakery in London. This photo is of the dj deck and was taken with a long exposure so the lights and buttons are longer than natural and distorted.

        This is a picture taken of The Artists Pallet in Death Valley, California. It's a bright sunny day and a picture of the mountain. Colors are very bright and include browns and greens.
