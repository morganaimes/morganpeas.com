      This photo was taken on a film camera along the canal in London. It is vertical, with plants in the top left corner and the canal running through the photo from the bottom right corner. The canal is dark grey/blue. A dead rat is floating in a ballerina style pose. It is beautiful.

      A friend was djing at a dark bakery in London. This photo is of the dj deck and was taken with a long exposure so the lights and buttons are longer than natural and distorted.
